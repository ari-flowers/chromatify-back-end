### MVP (Bronze)
ASU I want to be able to add entries to a database and store them for later use.
I want this database to connect to a functional front end to display the tracks  I have added.
ASU I want to be able to create, edit, and delete my entries from a front end UI.

### Silver
ASU I want to be able to create a user and have my created entries to be unique to my account. I want to be able to "favorite" entries from Spotify's API and have that action write data from the API to the Chromatify database.
I want to join these queries to have my created tracks display alongside Spotify's search results.

### Gold
ASU I want to be able to drag and drop search results into a "tresselboard" workspace so I can work with my songs in a way that is tactile and intuitive.
I want this drag and drop functionality to also interact with the database, creating associations where necessary.
ASU I want to be able to add tags to my tracks for further sorting that adds these as rows to the database.
Using these tags along with a data visualization tool, I want to be able to see my songs represented in a colorful UI.
